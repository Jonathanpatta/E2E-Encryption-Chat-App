This project uses the native Web Crypto API to encrypt, decrypt, generate keys and generate derived keys.

# E2E Encryption

* This app uses AES-GCM to encrypt data.
* The Diffie Hellman Key Exchange protocol is used to share keys between clients.
* Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman algorithm using the P-256 Curve is used to generate key pairs for clients.

# The Frontend

> The frontend is from web dev simplified's whatsapp clone tutorial, built in React, available [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Whatsapp-Clone)
